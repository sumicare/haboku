## Core Values

 - Brutal honesty always wins over hypocritical politeness 🪓
 - We are not special, we are not unique, we are not irreplaceable 🫥
 - We are building a viable product, not a dream 🛠️
 - Everything must be validated, not just speculated 🔍
 - We are changing the rules, "good" is always not enough 📏

Any viable organization needs:
 - Escalation chain – issues are escalated quickly, with clear actions and measurable outcomes ⚡️
 - Subordination chain – clear reporting lines and responsibilities 🧭
 - Delegation chain – decisions are delegated to those with the capability and capacity to deliver 🎯

### Constructive Behavior

 - We prioritize accountability and genuine collaboration over superficial agreement.
 - [Counterproductive work behaviour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counterproductive_work_behavior) and [Organization Deviance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Organization_deviance) undermine Agile practices.
 - Process should support product value, not replace it.
 - Best practices require discipline and clear intent to be effective.
 - We strive for excellence in all our strategies.

### Essential Competency and Validated Proficiency 🧠

We assume a "default competency" for each project and expect folks to:
 - Know Go at least at the [tour of go](https://tour.golang.org/) level 🐹
 - Know Node.js just enough to be able to build maintain large projects 🟢
 - Have [Terraform Associate](https://developer.hashicorp.com/certifications/infrastructure-automation) level understanding 🧱
 - Have [LFCS](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/linux-foundation-certified-sysadmin-lfcs/) skills to administer Linux and write shell scripts, prep container images 🐧
 - Have basic [LFCA](https://training.linuxfoundation.org/certification/certified-it-associate/) knowledge to understand how management works and what GitOps is 🧾
 - Hold [CKAD](https://www.cncf.io/certification/ckad/) to develop applications using common Kubernetes resources 📦
 - Hold [CKA](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cka/) for Kubernetes administration 🛳️
 - Know couple brief things about [CKS](https://www.cncf.io/certification/cks/) for supply chain and cluster security 🔐

We expect relevant proficiency, or the ability to gain relevant insight when needed.

Mental capacity and cognitive-complexity thresholds differ for everyone. We focus on validated proficiency rather than expecting universal knowledge.

When deploying to AWS, an [AWS Developer Associate](https://aws.amazon.com/training/certifications/developer-associate/) level understanding helps ensure security and reliability
(e.g., using AWS STS instead of hardcoded credentials).

### Security & Compliance 🛡️

Everything is encrypted and prepared for GDPR/BDSG/TTDSG compliance 🔐

We are committed to continuous improvement and rigorous standards.
We welcome constructive feedback and criticism ♻️

**We do not** publish sensitive internal details for security reasons.

**We do not** rely on security through obscurity; proper due diligence is always required.

Good starting points for understanding our expectations are:
 
 - SOC1 – Financial audit run over ~6 months (Type 2), with a public report confirming the company isn’t imploding from fraud or broken controls. Baseline street cred so others will do KYB and still talk to you. 📊
 - SOC2 – Non‑public security report that details how PII is locked down and how leaks are prevented/detected, also over ~6 months (Type 2). Shared with customers, partners, and private auditors; treated as a continuous process, with on‑demand reports for people who care when things hit the fan. 🧾
 - SOC3 – Public, simplified SOC2 for the general crowd. Fewer reporting requirements, more marketing, but it at least signals the company takes security somewhat seriously. 📣
