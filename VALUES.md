# Values

Inspired by the bold, unflinching strokes of haboku (破墨) in sumi-e painting and the disciplined asymmetry of ikebana, Haboku—and the broader Kachō ecosystem—adheres to principles of clarity, humility, precision, and sustained excellence.

## Core Tenets

- **Uncompromising Honesty**: Direct truth prevails over courteous evasion. Clear communication, even when difficult, builds lasting trust.
- **Humility in Craft**: No individual or solution is indispensable. We remain replaceable, adaptable, and open to better approaches.
- **Pragmatic Construction**: We build viable, market-ready systems grounded in reality—not unattainable visions.
- **Evidence Over Assumption**: Every decision and feature must be validated through data and observation, never mere speculation.
- **Relentless Improvement**: Conformity to existing standards is never sufficient. We challenge conventions and continually raise the bar.

## Compliance Aspirations

These established frameworks serve as reference points for our long-term commitments to reliability, security, and ethical practice:

- **SOC 2 Type 2**: Comprehensive security controls for protecting sensitive data, audited over an extended period and shared selectively with stakeholders.
- **SOC 1 Type 2**: Financial controls audit confirming operational integrity and fraud prevention; establishes foundational credibility.
- **SOC 3**: Public summary of security practices, signaling serious commitment to a broader audience.
- **ISO 27001**: Information Security Management System (ISMS) — systematic risk assessment and treatment.
- **ISO 27017**: Specific security controls for cloud service providers.
- **ISO 27018**: Protection of personally identifiable information (PII) in cloud environments.
- **ISO 27701**: Privacy Information Management System (PIMS) — enhanced access control and breach response.
- **ISO 42001**: Artificial Intelligence Management System (AIMS), aligned with emerging regulatory requirements such as the EU AI Act.
- **ISO 22301**: Business Continuity Management System (BCMS) — structured risk management and recovery planning.
- **ISO 20000-1**: Service Management System (SMS) for IT service delivery and resource governance.
- **ISO 9001**: Quality Management System (QMS) demonstrating consistent commitment to excellence.

These tenets and aspirations guide every module, ensuring Haboku provides not merely functional infrastructure, but a harmonious, enduring foundation for the Kachō ecosystem.
